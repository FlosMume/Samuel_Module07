    "        - Fine-tuned model: Base + LoRA adapter trained on your synthetic academic Q&A data\n",
    "\n",
    "    We will evaluate both models on 10 hand-crafted test questions that were **not in the training data**.\n",
    "    The goal is to assess whether fine-tuning improved:\n",
    "        - Accuracy and factual correctness\n",
    "        - Use of academic terminology\n",
    "        - Ability to handle edge cases (e.g., invalid assumptions)\n",

    "📘 Why This Matters:\n",
    "    Fine-tuning injects domain-specific knowledge into the model. This evaluation answers:\n",
    "        - Did the model learn from the synthetic Q&A dataset?\n",
